# Trainer

A mobile-first web app for tracking and planning gym sessions. Built with SvelteKit, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, backed by Azure Table Storage.

## Features

- **Plan screen** — View your weekly training plan, mark exercises complete with actual weight/reps
- **History screen** — Browse exercise history by date, track bodyweight trends with a chart
- **AI summary** — Weekly progress summary (mock provider, ready to swap for a real AI service)

## Tech Stack

- SvelteKit 2 (Svelte 5) + Vite+
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4 + daisyUI 5
- Azure Table Storage
- Azure OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini)
- Chart.js (weight trend chart)
- Vitest (unit tests)
- Azure Static Web Apps (deployment)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Vite+](https://viteplus.dev/) (`curl -fsSL https://vite.plus | bash`)
- [Azurite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite) for local Table Storage emulation (`npm install -g azurite`)

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Required — Azure Table Storage connection
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=UseDevelopmentStorage=true  # for local Azurite

# Optional — Azure OpenAI (app works without these, using rule-based fallbacks)
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://<resource>.openai.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=<key>
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o-mini  # default if omitted
```

### Run Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
vp pm install

# Copy env template and configure
cp .env.example .env

# Start Azurite (in another terminal)
azurite --silent --location .azurite --debug .azurite/debug.log

# Seed the database with sample data (6 weeks of progressive overload + bodyweight)
vp run seed

# Start dev server
vp dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) on your phone or in a mobile-width browser.

## Architecture

### API Routes

All server routes live under `/data/` (not `/api/`, which is reserved by Azure Static Web Apps):

| Route | Methods | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `/data/plans` | GET, POST, PUT | Fetch current week plan, create, or update a plan |
| `/data/plans/[weekId]` | GET | Fetch a specific week's plan by date (e.g. `2026-03-30`) |
| `/data/plans/next` | POST | Generate next week's plan via AI or rule-based provider |
| `/data/exercises` | GET, POST, DELETE | Query exercise logs (with `?from`, `?to`, `?limit`), log a session, remove an entry |
| `/data/weight` | GET, POST | Query bodyweight history, log a new entry |
| `/data/summary` | GET | Fetch weekly AI-generated summary |

### Service Layer

All data operations go through typed service modules in `src/lib/services/`, making it easy to swap storage backends or AI providers.

| Service | Responsibility |
|---------|---------------|
| `tableStorage.ts` | Thin wrapper around `@azure/data-tables`. Manages three tables (`Plans`, `ExerciseLogs`, `BodyWeight`), creates them on first access. Exports `DEFAULT_PK = "default"` for single-user partitioning. |
| `planService.ts` | CRUD operations for weekly training plans — fetch current week, fetch by date, upsert, range queries. |
| `exerciseService.ts` | Exercise log persistence with **merge logic** (same exercise on same date+day overwrites rather than duplicates). Also handles bodyweight logging and history. |
| `summaryService.ts` | Weekly progress summaries via a `SummaryProvider` interface. Ships with `MockSummaryProvider` (heuristic-based: session counts, bodyweight trends, PR detection, injury notes). |
| `openaiClient.ts` | Azure OpenAI client wrapper. Checks if LLM is configured and caches the client instance. |
| `planGenerationService.ts` | Next-week plan generation via a `PlanGenerationProvider` interface. Two implementations: `SmartCopyProvider` (rule-based progressive overload) and `LLMPlanProvider` (Azure OpenAI with coaching prompt). Falls back to SmartCopy on LLM error. |

### Azure Table Storage Schema

Single-user design — all data lives under partition key `"default"`. Extend to multi-user by varying the partition key.

| Table | Partition Key | Row Key | Data |
|-------|--------------|---------|------|
| **Plans** | `"default"` | ISO week-start date (`"2026-03-30"`) | JSON-serialised `WeeklyPlan` |
| **ExerciseLogs** | `"default"` | `reverseTimestamp(date)_day` | JSON-serialised `ExerciseLog` with actual weight/reps |
| **BodyWeight** | `"default"` | ISO date (`"2026-03-30"`) | `weight` (number, kg) |

**Reverse timestamp** (`9999999999999 - date.getTime()`) ensures newest entries sort first in Azure Table Storage's lexicographic ordering.

### Components

All components use Svelte 5 runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$props`).

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `BottomNav` | Fixed bottom tab bar (Plan / History) with active-state tracking |
| `SummaryBanner` | Collapsible weekly summary card (headline + expandable detail lines) |
| `DayPlan` | Expandable session card listing exercises for a day; shows completion count |
| `ExerciseCard` | Individual exercise with target/actual display, inline edit mode, complete/undo |
| `PlanEditor` | Modal for reviewing and saving generated plans |
| `WeightChart` | Chart.js line chart of bodyweight over time |
| `ExerciseProgressChart` | Chart.js line chart tracking one exercise's weight or total reps across weeks |

### Plan Generation Flow

```
User clicks "Generate next week"
  → POST /data/plans/next
  → Server fetches: current plan + this week's logs + last week's logs
  → Routes to provider:
      • LLMPlanProvider (if Azure OpenAI configured)
      • SmartCopyProvider (rule-based fallback)
  → SmartCopyProvider logic:
      • Hit all target reps → increase weight (+1kg light / +2.5kg heavy)
      • Missed reps → keep weight, add "Retry" note
      • No data → carry forward unchanged
  → Returns plan → shown in PlanEditor for review before saving
```

### Exercise Completion Flow

```
User taps "Mark Complete" on ExerciseCard
  → POST /data/exercises with exercise log
  → exerciseService.logExercise():
      • Computes rowKey = reverseTimestamp(date) + "_" + day
      • Fetches existing entity for that rowKey (if any)
      • Merges exercises by name (replace existing, append new)
      • Upserts merged entity
  → UI updates: shows actual values in green, counts toward progress
```

## Testing

Tests use Vitest (via `vite-plus/test`) with a jsdom environment.

```bash
vp test --run    # single run
vp test          # watch mode
```

**Mocking strategy**: each test mocks `tableStorage.getTableClient()` with a manual `TableClient` stub (`getEntity`, `upsertEntity`, `listEntities`, `deleteEntity`). Environment variables are stubbed via `tests/__mocks__/env.ts`.

**Coverage**: service CRUD operations, merge logic, date range filtering, date utilities, summary heuristics.

## Deployment

The app is configured for Azure Static Web Apps via `svelte-adapter-azure-swa`.

1. Create an Azure Static Web App resource
2. Set `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` in the SWA environment variables
3. Optionally set the `AZURE_OPENAI_*` variables for AI-powered plan generation
4. Connect your GitHub repo — the included GitHub Actions workflow handles CI/CD (lint → test → build → deploy)
